# `einfart` : write you articles in a simple and clear way

> **New documentations are still being written. For now, only the core code is included in TeX Live 2023 (old documentations have been removed from the distribution).**

`einfart` is a LaTeX class for typesetting articles, which has a simple and clear design.

Currently, it has native support to Chinese (simplified and traditional), English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (European and Brazilian), Russian and Spanish typesetting. And it may compile with either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.

This is part of the `minimalist` class series.

## Features

Compared with usual document classes, it has the following features:

- Several carefully designed styles
- Native multi-language support: Chinese (simplified and traditional), English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (European and Brazilian), Russian and Spanish
    > In particular, for simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese and Japanese, the fonts of the corresponding glyphs can be automatically switched
- Ready-to-use theorem-like environments, with clever referencing support
- Support both the standard and the AMS writing fashion
- ... and so much more...
