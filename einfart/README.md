# `einfart` : write you articles in a simple and clear way

**The current document class have been rewritten with `expl3`. Please note that the documentations are not yet up-to-date. The syntax of some commands have been changed since the last version, especially the declaration of theorem-like environments by `\CreateTheorem`. For the moment, you can refer to the documentation of the package `create-theorem`.**

`einfart` is a LaTeX class for typesetting articles, which has a simple and
clear design.

Currently, it has native support to Chinese (simplified and traditional),
English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (European and Brazilian),
Russian and Spanish typesetting. And it may compile with either XeLaTeX or
