# `minimalist` bundle: write you documents in a simple and clear way

A collection of styles and classes that helps you typesetting articles and books
with a simple and clear design. It mainly consists of two parts.

- Main part:
    - `minimalist.sty` : the main style
    - `minimart.cls` : class for typesetting articles
    - `minimbook.cls` : class for typesetting books

    They can be used with any major TeX engine. Currently they have native
    support to English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese
    (European and Brazilian) and Spanish typesetting.


- Derivative part (they have separate pages on CTAN):
    - `einfart.cls` : more advanced class for typesetting articles
    - `simplivre.cls` : more advanced class for typesetting books

    They are similar to the main classes, but have unicode support, thus can
    only be used with either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. Currently they have native
    support to Chinese (simplified and traditional), English, French, German,
    Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (European and Brazilian), Russian and Spanish
    typesetting, and also use more beautiful fonts.
